# Creating Swagpaths

A **swagpath** is a series of learning resources and/or activities (called **swagifacts**) organized in an ordered path to enable the player to gather skills and knowledge, while generating swag points. A swagpath can be visualized in a **swagmap**.

To earn the swag points for the "Creating a Usable Swagpath on http://content.tunapanda.org" skill, a player needs to complete the following swagpath:

1. Secure an author account.
2. Upload swagifacts or create them within the site.
3. Design the swagifacts into a swagpath.
4. Create a description for the swagpath.

## Step 1: Securing an author account

To secure an author account please send an email to wp-authors@tunapanda.org with a brief description of why you would like an account and what swagifacts or swagpaths you are interested in creating. We will respond within 48 business hours.

In the meantime, you can begin creating H5P swagifacts by either [test driving H5P](https://h5p.org/testdrive-h5p) or [installing H5P on your machine or website](https://h5p.org/installation). The H5P items you create now can be saved and uploaded to http://content.tunapanda.org later.

## Step 2: Uploading or creating H5P swagifacts

_Note: this step assumes you know how to author H5P items. You can [learn how to use H5P here](https://h5p.org/documentation/for-authors)._

First, head over to http://content.tunapanda.org/wp-admin and login with your Author Account (which you acquired in Step 1).
