###Course Presentation

Unless a course presentation has a large number of quizzes, the summary page is not necessary. To hide it, select the **"Behavior settings"** tab underneath the course presentation and check the box next to **"Hide Summary Slide"**.

The **keywords list** feature is useful to remind a player where she is on the swagifact and to assist in navigation. You can select **"Always show"** for it to remain visible for players to see and use.
